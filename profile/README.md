We are researching the client of a certain anime game and its communication. 

This is done with the goal to create an interoperable server alternative that in the long term allows custom content to be used on the client and will keep the game playable after its getting end of live at some point.

The repositories of this orga should not replace the official servers as long as they are running, and instead show our love for the game, by accompanying it. If you like the anime game, suport it's parent company, by playing on official servers.
