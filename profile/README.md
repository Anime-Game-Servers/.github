We are researching the client of a certain anime game and its communication. 

This is mostly done for educational purposes, but also with the goal to create an interoperable server alternative, accompanying the official server, by allowing custom content and keeping the game playable in the long term, after it reached it end of life in the far future (so when the official servers are shut down).

The repositories of this orga should not replace the official servers as long as they are running, and instead show our love for the game, by accompanying it. If you like the anime game, suport it's parent company, by playing on the official servers.
